                * Analyzed various technical alternatives to
                Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) draft specification by W3C on
                the strength of content protection, interoperability,
                accessebility, security and privacy. The work required
                understanding of the process of development of web standards,
                understanding of internals of HTML video and understanding of the
                application of Copyright laws in internet.

                * Performed a diversity analysis on participants of the debate
                on Encrypted Media Extensions on the public-html mailing list
                of W3C and found out that none of the participants from the
                continents of Asia, Africa or South America.

            Wikipedia Human Gender Indicators (WHGI)
            is a Wikimedia sponsored project which aims to
            develop statistical and quantitative indicators for gender gap
            and raise awareness by observing the trend of gender in biography
            articles. During my internship I:
            * Wrote data pipeline and analysis to compare the occupational
                gender gap in statistics obtained from US Bureau of Labor and
                Statistics and the data obtained from wikidata.
            * Created data pipelines and an interactive portal to display data analysis.
            * Analyzed and compared the occupational data from Wikipedia
                biographies with the data provided by US Bureau of Labor Statistics

            Afra is an underdevelopment project to crowdsource genome annotation. During my intership I:
            * Wrote automated test suite in JavaScript's Jasmine
                framework.

    - title: Student Developer
      org: Google Summer of Code (GSoC) - SymPy
      period: May 2014 to August 2014
      description: |
            SymPy is a python library for symbolic computation.
            During the summer I wrote the new solveset module of SymPy. These
            new solvers provides a clear input and output interface, removes
            inconsistency between real and complex solvers and supports
            infinite solutions. I've remained involved with SymPy much after
            the summer and have mentored GSoC students both in summer of 2015
            and 2016 to carry forward the work I started.

            BreatheArts is an online platform to sell and purchase art. I
            implemented a login system using OpenID and fixed the password
            recovery system on Breathe Art's ASP.NET online art galleries.

    - title: Monitoring the Gender Gap with Wikipedia Human Gender Indicators
      conf: OpenSym 16 Proceedings of the 12th International Symposium on Open Collaboration
      authors: Maximilian Klein, Harsh Gupta, Vivek Rai, Piotr Konieczny, Haiyi Zhu
      abstract: |

                The gender gap in Wikipedia’s content, specifically in the representation of women in biographies, is well-known but has been difficult to measure. Furthermore the impacts of efforts to address this gender gap have received little attention. To investigate we utilise Wikidata, the database that feeds Wikipedia, and introduce the “Wikidata Human Gender Indicators” (WHGI), a free and open source, longitudinal, biographical dataset monitoring gender disparities across time, space, culture, occupation and language. Through these lenses we show how the representation of women is changing along 11 dimensions. Validations of WHGI are presented against three exogenous datasets: the world’s historical population, “traditional” gender-disparity indices (GDI, GEI, GGGI and SIGI), and occupational gender according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Furthermore, to demonstrate its general use in research, we revisit previously published findings on Wikipedia’s gender bias that can be strengthened by WHGI.

      abstract: |
          SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become the standard symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select domain specific submodules. The supplementary materials provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.
